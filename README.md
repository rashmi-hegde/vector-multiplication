# vector-multiplication

### Vector multiplication can be performed in three ways:
 
•	Scalar Multiplication

•	Dot Product Multiplication


•	Cross Product Multiplication
 

Let's start with scalar multiplication in other words; multiplying a vector by a single numeric value.Suppose I want to multiply my vector by 2.
The result of this calculation is a new vector named w. Recall that v is defined like this, To calculate 2v, we simply need to apply the operation to each dimension value in the vector matrix, like this.
 
### Which gives us the following result?

 
In Python, you can apply these sorts of matrix operations directly to numpy arrays.
